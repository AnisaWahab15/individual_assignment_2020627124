<h2>My UiTM Experience</h2>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><p>Association Of Information Scientists (AIS)</p></b>
<i><p>Association Of Information Scientists (AIS) is a club under Faculty Of Information Management for diploma students and involvement of club members are only for information management student from semester 1 until semester 5. As for me, I was involve with this club by becoming club members as secretariat for AIS since semester 1 and I was appointed as Multimedia and Innovation EXCO in semester 3 until semester 5. While hold the position offered, there many new experiences I gain and also there are many new things I learn like design a poster, making montage video, writing official letter for program and also involving many program like international events, annually faculty events and also private special events. However, while holding and serve for this club, we as club members also had to face many kind of challenges, as for in previous Faculty Academic Award of 2022, I was in charge of the food. Due to our bad luck, all food that had being serve was stale and all the student were not given food for the event. No matter what happen all the events was run smoothly and everything that happened, every Cloud Has a Silver Lining for us as organizer. </p></i>

<b><p>Jawatankuasa Perwakilan Kolej Tun Hussein Onn (JPKTHO)</p></b>
<i><p>UiTM Machang was quite far from my home, so I choose to stay at college when I was semester 2. In semester 2, I got admitted to college because I was chosen to be one of the Police Curriculum candidates. So in semester 2, I start to stay at college because of that curriculum, even all others my classmates stay at home. After all, because of staying college earlier, I got chosen to be one of secretariat of college representative committee of Tun Hussein Onn College. After two semesters being one secretariat of college representative committee of Tun Hussein Onn College, then in semester 3, I got to became officially college representative committee of Tun Hussein Onn College until semester 5. With this, I learn about many kind of human being because of handling student at college was not easy as its look. Like when I was in semester 2, some of student that I must handle are from degreeâ€™s students, they are really annoying and stubborn because don't want to listen and don't follow the rules. However, I could manage it all with all my other secretariat members. In this semester 2, we also did not back home for Eid because of covid. After all that happened, many things that I could learn from being one of JPKTHO, from handling online program to face to face program, everything was fun with that experience,  and for our last JPKTHO program, all JPKTHO members will go to Thailand for international program. </p></i>
